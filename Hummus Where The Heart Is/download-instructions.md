# How to Get Your Game Files for itch.io

## For Mocha Web Users:

Since you're using Mocha's web-based environment, you'll need to use one of these methods:

### Method 1: Screenshot and Recreate (Simplest)
1. Your game is already published at: https://nhrzzjx63dira.mocha.app
2. You can link directly to this URL on your itch.io page
3. Or take screenshots of your game and create a simple HTML wrapper

### Method 2: Export via Mocha Interface
Look for these options in your Mocha interface:
- Export/Download project files
- Download as ZIP
- Export to GitHub (then download from GitHub)

### Method 3: Manual Recreation
If other methods don't work:
1. Copy the HTML from your index.html file
2. Save all the game assets (images) from the Mocha CDN URLs
3. Create a simple HTML file that includes your game
